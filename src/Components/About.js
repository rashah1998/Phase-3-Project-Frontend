            <h3 className="about-headers">Carnivorous</h3> 
            <p className="about-body">The carnivore diet is straightforward: eat only animal foods and stay away from all plant foods. This means that you get your energy primarily from protein and fat and consume close to zero carbohydrates. The carnivore diet means eliminating plant foods, so no fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, seeds, or legumes.</p>

            <h3 className="about-headers">Keto</h3>
            <p className="about-body">People on a ketogenic diet eat a very small amount of carbohydrates, a moderate amount of protein, and a high amount of fat per day. This means that the body burns fat as its main source of fuel and breaks it down into 'ketone bodies' (or 'ketones') in a process called ketosis.</p>

            <h3 className="about-headers">Pescatarian</h3>
            <p className="about-body">Pescatarians have a lot in common with vegetarians. They eat fruits, veggies, nuts, seeds, whole grains, beans, eggs, and dairy, and stay away from meat and poultry. But there's one way they part company from vegetarians: Pescatarians eat fish and other seafood.
